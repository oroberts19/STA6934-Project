# Part 1 {.tabset}  
With our time series data we plan to:  
1) Forecast US GDP growth   
2) Analyze how % of youth not in education/training (share of youth NEET) explains current unemployment rate  

# Part 2 {.tabset}  
Methodology for each respective model includes:  
1) Forecasting model:  
Check for constant variance: employ either log transformation or Box-Cox transformation if needed.
Compare forecasting models (naive, seasonal naive, drift). Use cross validation to confirm which simple forecasting method is best. 
Perform Box-Jenkins method to fit ARIMA(p,d,q) model
Validate best model looking at metrics such as AIC and RMSE instead of cross validation because of manual selection process of the best model.  
Check residuals to further validate best model choice as well as confirm goodness of fit and quality of predictions.

2) Analytical model:
Confirm correlation between explanatory and response variable
Fit linear regression model  
Diagnose residuals (we assume assumptions will be violated). Observe results of Breusch-Godfray test to look for autocorrelations in the linear model's residuals.  
Fit a dynamic regression on ARIMA errors.  
Check residuals to confirm no assumptions are violated for goodness of fit.  
If residual assumptions aren't violated, perform inference and compare results to those of linear regression.
